because the device is what Project 2 needs later for real timings, and a Neuron device cannot be
shared by two processes. The model therefore comes from the shared endpoint, not from a server on
your own chip.

nisa.nc_matmul has strict memory rules: dst must live in nl.psum, while stationary and moving must
both live in nl.sbuf. So the pattern is: dma_copy both operands from HBM into sbuf tiles, allocate a
psum tile for the result, call nc_matmul(dst=psum_tile, stationary=..., moving=...), then
tensor_copy from psum into an sbuf tile, then dma_copy that out to the shared_hbm output.
The left operand arrives already transposed, with K on the partition axis.

Slice tiles with ranges, e.g. a[0:128, 0:64]. A complete kernel looks like this:
