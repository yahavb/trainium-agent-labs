### nki.language.gather_flattened {#nki-language-gather_flattened}

`nki.language.gather_flattened(data, indices, axis, dtype)`

**Signature:**
```python
language.gather_flattened(data, indices, axis=0, dtype=None)
```

Gather elements from data tensor using indices after flattening.

This instruction gathers elements from the data tensor using integer indices
provided in the indices tensor. For each element in the indices tensor, it
retrieves the corresponding value from the data tensor using the index value
to select from the free dimension of data.

>

- **data** — input tensor to gather from.
- **indices** — indices to gather.
- **axis** — axis along which to gather.
- **dtype** — (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see [Supported Data Types](nki.api.shared.md#nki-dtype) for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
**Returns:** gathered tensor.

Examples:

```python
import nki.language as nl

# nki.language.gather_flattened -- gather elements by index
data = nl.load(data_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
indices = nl.load(indices_tensor[0:128, 0:512])
result = nl.gather_flattened(data, indices)
nl.store(actual_tensor[0:128, 0:512], result)
```

### nki.language.load {#nki-language-load}

`nki.language.load(src, dtype)`

**Signature:**
```python
language.load(src, dtype=None)
```

Load a tensor from device memory (HBM) into on-chip memory (SBUF).

>

- **src** — HBM tensor to load the data from.
- **dtype** — (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see [Supported Data Types](nki.api.shared.md#nki-dtype) for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
**Returns:** a new tile on SBUF with values from `src`.

### nki.language.load_transpose2d {#nki-language-load_transpose2d}

`nki.language.load_transpose2d(src, dtype)`

**Signature:**
```python
language.load_transpose2d(src, dtype=None)

> **Warning:**
>
> This API is experimental and may change in future releases.
>

- **src** — HBM tensor to load the data from.
- **dtype** — (optional) data type to cast the output type to (see [Supported Data Types](nki.api.shared.md#nki-dtype) for more information); if not specified, it will default to be the same as the data type of the input tile.
**Returns:** a new tile on SBUF with values from `src` 2D-transposed.

### nki.language.shared_constant {#nki-language-shared_constant}

`nki.language.shared_constant(constant)`

**Signature:**
```python
language.shared_constant(constant)
```

Create a tensor in shared HBM initialized with constant data.

The constant is embedded in the compiled binary and loaded to HBM
at model load time. With LNC=2, both cores share the same constant;
the data must not diverge across cores.

Supported element types: float32, float16, bfloat16, int32, int16,
int8, uint32, uint16, uint8, float8_e4m3fn, float8_e5m2,
float8_e8m0fnu.
Packed types (float8_e4m3fn_x4, float8_e5m2_x4, float4_e2m1fn_x4)
and tfloat32 are supported at the MLIR level but not yet tested
end-to-end on hardware.

- **constant** — the constant data. Can be a numpy array or a file path
    to a `.npy` file.
**Returns:** an NkiTensor in shared_hbm containing the constant data.

>

- **dst** — HBM tensor to store the data into.
- **value** — an SBUF tile that contains the values to store.
