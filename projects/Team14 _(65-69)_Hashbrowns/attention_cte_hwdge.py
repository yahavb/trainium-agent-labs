# MODIFIED for trainium-agent-labs (projects/02-kernel-agent): a copy of
# nkilib/core/attention/attention_cte.py as shipped in the seat-68 image (vllm-neuron 0.24), with two
# changes and nothing else:
#   1. the 8 nisa.dma_copy calls in _load_k_tile, _load_q_tile, _load_v_tile -- the Q, K and V
#      tile loads -- pass dge_mode=nisa.dge_mode.hwdge, so the hardware DGE block builds their
#      descriptors instead of GpSimd in software: the change that made the single-tile attention
#      kernel V4 (my_attention.py) ~11% faster. The output write-backs (_write_back_impl,
#      _write_back_o_impl) stay on the default: they move float32 (mm_out_dtype) to and from the bf16
#      output, and hwdge cannot convert dtypes -- neuronx-cc rejects them with "[NCC_IBIR098]
#      Unsupported DGE Type: expect one of DGE types None, SWDGE, but got HWDGE".
#   2. relative imports (from ..utils.X) are absolute (from nkilib.core.utils.X), so this file loads

Attention Kernel For Context Encoding (Prefill)

ALGORITHM OVERVIEW:

Base Attention Algorithm:
The kernel computes: Output = softmax(scale * Q @ K^T) @ V

Breaking this down into steps:
  1. Compute attention scores: S = scale * Q @ K^T  (matmul, called MM1)
  2. Apply masking to S (causal, sliding window, etc.)
  3. Compute row-wise softmax: P = softmax(S) = exp(S - max(S)) / sum(exp(S - max(S)))
  4. Compute final output: O = P @ V  (matmul, called MM2)

The transpose flags (tp_q, tp_k, tp_out) control input/output tensor layouts without
changing the mathematical computation.

For a simple PyTorch reference implementation, see attention_cte_torch.py

FEATURES:

1. Causal Masking (causal_mask=True):
   - Masks upper triangle of attention scores: S[i,j] = -inf when i < j
   - Enables compute skipping: skip MM1/MM2 for upper triangle tiles

2. Sliding Window Attention (SWA, when sliding_window > 0):
   - Local attention: each query only attends to nearby keys within a window
   - Masks attention scores: S[i,j] = -inf when |i - j| > sliding_window
   - Currently only works with causal: masks both upper triangle AND positions outside window
   - When used with CP: loads only required KV slice to save memory

3. Context Parallelism (CP, global_cp_deg > 1, cp_offset is not None):
   - Distributes long sequence computation across multiple devices/ranks
   - Each rank (kernel call) processes a slice of Q sequence with full K/V
   - cp_offset indicates which Q slice this rank handles (runtime value)
   - Optionally supports strided Q slicing for better load balancing across CP ranks
   - Requires dynamic masking since offset unknown at compile time
   - Currently only supports causal attention

4. Prefix Caching (k_prior/v_prior provided):
   - K/V split into two parts: prior (cached) and active (current)
   - prior_used_len specifies how much of prior to use (dynamic mask)
   - Causal mask not required for prior portion (although we still apply SWA if applicable)

5. Sink Tokens (sink provided):
   - Add additional sink token to softmax denominator

6. Sequence Packing (bound_min/bound_max provided):
   - Multiple independent sequences are packed into a single tensor
   - Each query position has a [bound_min, bound_max) range defining which KV positions it attends to
   - Positions outside the range are masked with -inf, preventing cross-sequence attention
   - Compatible with causal masking (both masks are applied simultaneously)
   - Not compatible with prefix caching

7. Grouped Query Attention (GQA, batch_size_kv < batch_size):
   - Kernel handles GQA natively without explicit K/V replication

7. Support for training:
   - Kernel can optionally return maximum attention score and softmax denominator (per row) for backpropagation.

8. Position Bias (position_bias provided):
   - Adds a position-bias tensor to QK scores before scaling and masking
   - Supports relative position bias schemes such as T5 and ALiBi
   - Bias is pre-loaded into PSUM before the matmul (accumulate mode), giving zero overhead
   - Masking paths operate on the already-biased scores: final = mask(scale * (QK + bias))
   - Two storage layouts are supported via the bias_layout kwarg:
       * "dense" (default): rectangular (batch, seqlen_q, seqlen_kv) in the kernel's
         padded KV layout (prior_padded | active). Simplest, highest HBM footprint.
       * "banded": compact (batch, seqlen_q, total_band_cols) for locally-banded biases
         (e.g. sliding-window attention). The third axis stacks a rectangular prior
         region, a sheared active band, and zero-fill padding so the shear stays
         in-bounds at segment boundaries. See bias_band_params for the contract.
   - Compatible with causal masking, sliding window, and prefix caching

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AND LOOP STRUCTURE:

Level 1: LNC2 Sharding (on Trn2+)
  - Shards computation across 2 NeuronCores (LNC=2)
  - Primary sharding: Divides batch dimension evenly
  - Secondary sharding (for odd batch): Last batch item sharded on seqlen_q
    * Uses unequal split (65%/35%) for causal attention to balance load
    * Falls back to single core for short sequences (< 1024 tokens)

Level 2: Batch Loop
  - Iterates over batch items assigned to this core
  - Each batch item processes independently
  - For GQA: maps Q batch_id to correct KV batch_id

Level 3: Section Loop (Flash Attention for long sequences)
  - For K/V length > 10K tokens: divide into 8K-token sections
  - Process one section at a time to fit in SBUF memory
  - Maintains running statistics (max, sum) across sections
  - Final output computed using flash attention rescaling
  - For short sequences: single section contains all K/V
  - Check https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08691
    for more details about flash attention.

Level 4: Group Loop (Q sequence processing)
  - Q sequence divided into groups of 128 tokens (_Q_GRP_SZ)
  - Each group processes independently within a section
  - Software pipelining: overlaps operations across groups (i, i+1, i+2)
    * Group i:   PV computation, writeback
    * Group i+1: Exp computation
    * Group i+2: Q load, QK computation
  - Uses modular allocation for efficient buffer reuse

INTENDED USAGE:

The kernel supports sequence lengths up to 36864 and is optimized for q sequence
length larger than ~256 (i.e., prefill/context encoding workloads). The head dimension (d)
can be up to 128. Batch size up to 16 has been tested.

Input dtypes can be bfloat16, float16 or float32. The kernel uses float32 for softmax and
bfloat16 for other operations.

      scale (float, optional): Scaling factor for attention scores. It must be set to 1.0 (default value) when
                     using sliding window, context parallel, or prefix caching. In these cases, q

                     to attend to, with shape (batch, seqlen_q, 1). Query position i attends only to KV
                     positions j where bound_min[..., i, :] <= j < bound_max[..., i, :]. Must be provided
                     together with bound_max. Not compatible with prefix caching.
      bound_max (nt.tensor, optional): (Sequence packing) Per-query upper bound (exclusive) of the KV range
                     to attend to, with shape (batch, seqlen_q, 1). Must be provided together with bound_min.
      cp_striped_input (bool, optional): Whether the input sequence was distributed across CP ranks
                     in round-robin (striped) order rather than contiguous chunks. When True, the
                     caller must set cp_offset to 0 (include diagonal, q_rank >= kv_rank) or -1
                     (exclude diagonal, q_rank < kv_rank). Requires causal_mask=True. Not compatible
                     with sliding window or prefix caching. Default False.
      skip_output_normalization (bool): When True, skips the final 1/S normalization of the output
                     and returns the raw softmax denominator (exp_running_sum) instead of its
                     reciprocal (exp_sum_reciprocal). This avoids wasted work when the caller
                     (e.g., ring attention) needs unnormalized outputs for cross-step reduction
                     and will normalize once at the very end.
                     IMPORTANT: Must be used together with cache_softmax=True. When enabled:
                       - Output is unnormalized: out = exp(scores - max) @ V (not divided by S)
                       - Third return value is raw sum S (not 1/S)
                       - Caller is responsible for final normalization: final_out = out / S
                     Default False.
      position_bias (nt.tensor, optional): Position bias tensor added to QK scores
                     before scaling and masking. Implements relative position bias as used
                     in T5 and ALiBi. The bias is pre-loaded into PSUM and the matmul
                     accumulates on top, giving:
                         final_scores = mask(scale * (Q @ K^T + position_bias)).
                     Shape depends on ``bias_layout``:
                       - ``"dense"`` (default): ``(batch_size, seqlen_q, seqlen_kv)``, where
                         the third dim covers the kernel's padded KV range. When prefix
                         caching is active that range is
                         ``align_to(seqlen_prior, 512) + seqlen_k_active``.
                       - ``"banded"``: ``(batch_size, seqlen_q, total_band_cols)``. The third
                         axis packs a rectangular prior region and a sheared active band
                         separated by zero padding so the shear stays in-bounds for
                         boundary Q tiles. The exact column layout is given by
                         ``bias_band_params`` (see below).
                     Constraints (both layouts):
                       - seqlen_q must be a multiple of 128
                     Note: the bias is scaled along with QK. For ALiBi-style unscaled bias,
                     pre-divide by scale: ``position_bias = alibi / scale``.
                     Default None (no position bias).
      bias_layout (str, optional): ``"dense"`` or ``"banded"``. Default ``"dense"``.
      bias_band_params (dict, optional): Required when ``bias_layout="banded"``. Describes
                     the column layout along the last axis of ``position_bias``. Keys:
                       - ``prior_band_width`` (int, >= 0): width of the rectangular prior
                         region. Columns ``[0, prior_band_width)`` hold prior bias values
                         (identical across Q rows, i.e. not sheared).
                       - ``active_offset`` (int, >= 0): column at which the sheared active
                         band begins. Must satisfy
                         ``active_offset >= prior_band_width + (_Q_GRP_SZ - 1)``. The
                         ``_Q_GRP_SZ - 1 = 127`` columns between the prior region and the
                         active band MUST be zero-filled by the caller; they absorb the
                         shear undershoot at the first Q tile of a segment.
                       - ``active_band_width`` (int, >= 0): width of the active band.
                         The mapping into the sheared axis is
                         ``position_bias[b, q, active_offset + j] ==
                          dense_active[b, q, q + j + active_origin]``
                         for ``j`` in ``[0, active_band_width)`` where ``dense_active`` is
                         the equivalent dense (batch, seqlen_q, seqlen_k_active) bias.
                       - ``active_origin`` (int): shift for the active band. For a causal
                         SWA window of radius ``R`` ending at the diagonal, set
                         ``active_origin = -(active_band_width - 1)`` so
                         ``j = active_band_width - 1`` is the diagonal.
                     The third axis must also leave ``>= _K_TILE_SZ - 1 = 511`` zero-filled
                     padding columns after the active band to absorb shear overshoot on
                     the last Q tile.

    Returns:
      Output tensor with attention results. Shape depends on tp_out parameter.
      If cache_softmax is True, returns tuple of (output, out_neg_max, out_sum_recip).
      If skip_output_normalization is also True, the output is unnormalized and the
      third element is the raw softmax denominator S (not 1/S).

    IO Shapes:
      - q:
        (batch_size, seqlen_q, d) when tp_q is True
        (batch_size, d, seqlen_q) when tp_q is False
      - k:
        (batch_size_kv, seqlen_kv, d) when tp_k is True
        (batch_size_kv, d, seqlen_kv) when tp_k is False
      - v: (batch_size_kv, seqlen_kv, d)
      - returns output with shape:
        (batch_size, d, seqlen_q) if tp_out is True
        (batch_size, seqlen_q, d) if tp_out is False

      - The math performed is softmax(q @ k) @ v (details described in top-level documentation)

    Prefix Caching:
      If k_prior, v_prior and prior_used_len are specified for prefix caching, the
      computation is equivalent to prepending the prior k/v (up to prior_used_len)
      behind the active k/v and shifting the mask accordingly. The shapes of k_prior
      and v_prior must match the shapes of k and v respectively on the non-seqlen
      dimensions, while the shape of prior_used_len is (1,). By setting prior_used_len,
      the actual prefix length can be chosen dynamically at runtime (up to seqlen_prior).

    MHA and Native GQA Support:
      For MHA attention, the heads can be included as part of the batch dimension.
      For GQA, when batch_size_kv < batch_size, we expect that batch_size % batch_size_kv == 0,
      and the computation is equivalent to first applying torch_interleave on K and V.
      Note that GQA typically applies to nheads dimension but the kernel combines
      batch and nheads dimensions.

    Softmax Caching (useful during training):
      When cache_softmax is True and out_neg_max/out_sum_recip are provided, returns
      the negative max and reciprocal sum in the softmax with shapes:
        padded_seq_grps = ceil(seqlen_q / 128) (_Q_GRP_SZ = 128)
        neg_max: (batch_size, 128, padded_seq_grps)
        recip: (batch_size, 128, padded_seq_grps)

    Context Parallel Support:
      Enabled when global_cp_deg is set. Since the Q seqlen offset is usually not
      known at compile time (based on rank ID), it is expected to be a (1, 1) HBM
      input to the kernel. global_cp_deg (a compile time constant int) denotes total
      number of ranks / CP degree.

      When cp_strided_q_slicing is False, this indicates FAL has sharded Q into contiguous chunks.
      In this case, cp_offset should be passed as rank_id * partial_q_seqlen

      When cp_strided_q_slicing is True, this indicates Q has been sharded in row-strided manner
      where stride is global_cp_deg. In this case, cp_offset should be passed as rank_id. Note that
      K & V are still assumed to be contiguous.

      As an example for seqlen_q=4, seqlen_kv=12, global_cp_deg=3, rank_id = 1:
        cp_strided_q_slicing False => q seqlen slice is [4, 5, 6, 7] and cp_offset is 4.
        cp_strided_q_slicing True  => q seqlen slice is [1, 4, 7, 10] and cp_offset is 1.
        In both cases, KV token order is simply [0, 1, 2, ..., 10, 11]

    Pseudocode:

    """Internal attention implementation with full parameter set including SBUF I/O.

    Contains the core attention logic including validation, batch loop, and LNC sharding.
    Called by attention_cte() (public API) and directly by internal callers
    (segmented attention, ring attention) that need SBUF parameters.

    See attention_cte() for documentation of shared parameters.

    Additional internal parameters:
      k_cache_sbuf: List[nl.NkiTensor]: List of k cache tiles, shape (batch_size_kv, d, k_tile_sz), k_tile_sz = 512
      v_cache_sbuf: List[nl.NkiTensor]: List of v cache tiles, shape (batch_size_kv, v_tile_sz, d), v_tile_sz = 128
      k_prior_sbuf: List[nl.NkiTensor]: (Segmented attention) List of k prior tiles in SBUF, shape (d, 512) per tile
      v_prior_sbuf: List[nl.NkiTensor]: (Segmented attention) List of v prior tiles in SBUF, shape (128, d) per tile
      init_sbuf_addr: the address where the sbuf allocation should start
      k_scale_sb: Optional SBUF tensor (pmax, 1) for delayed fp8 K dequantization. When provided,
                  Q is scaled by k_scale_sb in SBUF instead of scaling all K tiles, avoiding redundant
                  per-tile scaling. Applied as Q = Q * k_scale_sb before QK^T matmul.
      kv_used_len: Optional SBUF tensor (shape (1,) or (1, 1), int32). Lets the
                  kernel perform non-causal attention with the KV cache length
                  as a runtime value. This is needed so a single memory copy of
                  the k_cache_sbuf / v_cache_sbuf tensor can be reused for both
                  the active segment and the prior segment, enabling support
                  for large prior_seg_size in the segmented kernel.
      block_size: int: KV cache block size for round-robin KV distribution.
      kvp_rank_id: Optional[nl.NkiTensor]: (1,1) HBM int32, this rank's index within the KV-parallel group.
      kvp_group_size: int: Number of ranks in the KV-parallel group (0 = disabled).
      kvp_seg_block_offset: Optional[nl.NkiTensor]: (1,1) HBM int32, segment starting local block
          index. Used to compute the runtime offset for static mask bounds adjustment.
      kvp_cp_offset_int: int: Compile-time Q global offset for tile_fully_visible check.
      kvp_k_threshold_sb: Optional SBUF tensor with pre-generated static K-position threshold pattern.
      kvp_seg_block_offset_int: int: Compile-time seg_block_offset for tile_fully_visible check.

    Internal implementation function for attention computation.

    with flash attention optimization, sectioning, and various masking strategies.

      q, k_active, v_active: Input tensors
      k_prior, v_prior, prior_used_len: Prefix caching tensors
      o: Output tensor
      batch_id, batch_id_kv: Batch indices

      sink: Optional sink token tensor
      out_neg_max, out_sum_recip: Optional softmax cache outputs
      shard_seqlen_q_start, shard_seqlen_q_length: Seqlen sharding parameters
      cp_offset: Context parallel offset tensor
      bound_min, bound_max: Optional bound tensors for sequence packing
      k_cache_sbuf, v_cache_sbuf: Optional pre-loaded K/V cache tiles in SBUF
      k_prior_sbuf, v_prior_sbuf: Optional pre-loaded K/V prior tiles in SBUF
      init_sbuf_addr: Initial SBUF address for allocation
      k_scale_sb: Optional SBUF tensor (pmax, 1) for delayed fp8 K dequantization

    High-level logic:
    For large enough K/V length, we divide the K/V into sections of 8k.

    For each section:
      a. Load K and V to SBUF
      b. Loop over Q (groups) - each group has seqlen 128 (_Q_GRP_SZ)
      c. Within each group:
        i.   Load Q
        ii.  Compute QK^T (MM1) and max
        iii. Compute exponential and transpose
        iv.  Compute PV (MM2)
        v.   Write to output

    Handling multiple sections:
      We keep running max, sum, etc. buffers that we keep updating as we go through
      sections and use these to update the output using flash attention.

    Pipelining:
      To maximize utilization of the hw engines, we use software pipelining to
      inform scheduler decisions. This means we manually interleave iterations of
      the group loop to make sure certain operations of group i+2 should start even
      as group i is being processed. In addition we use modulo allocation for tensors
      to enable pipelining across Q groups and K/V tiles within a section.

      ``position_bias[batch_id, q_seqlen_offset:+num_p_bias, abs_k_pos:+num_k_bias]``.
      When the K tile overlaps the end of the bias tensor, the trailing
      columns of ``bias_sb_tile`` are zeroed so the subsequent

    - ``"banded"``: sheared access. Columns ``[0, prior_band_width)`` hold a
      rectangular prior band (identical across Q rows); the sheared active band
      lives at ``[active_offset, active_offset + active_band_width)`` with
      ``banded[b, q, active_offset + j] == dense_active[b, q, q + j + active_origin]``.
      Because the kernel's prior range is 512-aligned, a single K tile of width
