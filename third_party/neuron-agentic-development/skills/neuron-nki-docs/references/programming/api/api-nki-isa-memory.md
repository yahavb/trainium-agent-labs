### nki.isa.dma_compute {#nki-isa-dma_compute}

`nki.isa.dma_compute(dst, srcs, reduce_op, scales, unique_indices, oob_mode, name)`

**Engine:** DMA Engine

**Signature:**
```python
isa.dma_compute(dst, srcs, reduce_op, scales=None, unique_indices=True, oob_mode=oob_mode_enum.error, name=None)
```

Perform math operations using compute logic inside DMA engines with element-wise scaling and reduction.

This instruction leverages the compute capabilities within DMA engines to perform scaled element-wise operations
followed by reduction across multiple source tensors. The computation follows the pattern:
`dst = reduce_op(srcs[0] * scales[0], srcs[1] * scales[1], ...)`, where each source tensor is first
multiplied by its corresponding scale factor, then all scaled results are combined using the specified
reduction operation.
Currently, only `nl.add` is supported for `reduce_op`, and
all values in `scales` must be `1.0` (or `scales` can be `None`
which defaults to all 1.0).

The DMA engines perform all computations in float32 precision internally. Input tensors are automatically
cast from their source data types to float32 before computation, and the final float32 result is cast
to the output data type in a pipelined fashion.

**Read-Modify-Write with vector_offset (scatter and gather).**

When one of the source tensors has a `vector_offset` (indirect indexing),
`dma_compute` performs read-modify-write with two modes:

**Scatter RMW**: `dst(HBM)[indices] = dst(HBM)[indices] + src(SB)`
  - `dst` is in HBM with indirect indexing
  - One source matches `dst` and has `vector_offset`
  - The other source is data in SBUF

**Gather RMW**: `dst(SB) = dst(SB) + src(HBM)[indices]`
  - `dst` is in SBUF
  - One source is data in HBM with `vector_offset`
  - The other source matches `dst`

Both modes require:
  - Exactly 2 source tensors
  - All `scales` must be `1.0` (or `None`)
  - `unique_indices` must be `True` (non-unique indices not yet supported)

The only supported DGE mode for read-modify-write (scatter/gather) is SW DGE.
For `dma_compute` without `vector_offset`, the only supported DGE mode is None (static DMA).
The compiler automatically assigns the correct DGE mode.

**Memory types.**

Both input `srcs` tensors and output `dst` tensor can be in HBM or SBUF.
Both `srcs` and `dst` tensors must have compile-time known addresses (unless using vector_offset for indirect access).

**Data types.**

All input `srcs` tensors and the output `dst` tensor can be any supported NKI data types
(see nki-dtype for more information). The DMA engines automatically cast input data types to float32
before performing the scaled reduction computation. The float32 computation results are then cast to the
data type of `dst` in a pipelined fashion.

**Layout.**

The computation is performed element-wise across all tensors, with the reduction operation applied
across the scaled source tensors at each element position.

**Tile size.**

The element count of each tensor in `srcs` and `dst` must match exactly.
The max number of source tensors in `srcs` is 16.

- **dst** — the output tensor to store the computed results
- **srcs** — a list of input tensors to be scaled and reduced
- **reduce_op** — the reduction operation to apply (currently only `nl.add` is supported)
- **scales** — (optional) a list of scale factors corresponding to each
               tensor in `srcs`. Must be all 1.0 if provided.
               Defaults to None (equivalent to [1.0, 1.0, ...]).
- **unique_indices** — (optional) Whether scatter indices are unique.
                      Must be True when using vector_offset (non-unique
                      not yet supported). Default: True.
- **oob_mode** — (optional) Specifies how to handle out-of-bounds (oob)
                 array indices during indirect access operations. Valid
                 modes are:

    - `oob_mode.error`: (Default) Raises an error when encountering
      out-of-bounds indices.
    - `oob_mode.skip`: Silently skips any operations involving
      out-of-bounds indices.

    For example, when using indirect gather/scatter operations with
    `vector_offset`, out-of-bounds indices can occur if the index
    array contains values that exceed the dimensions of the target array.

### nki.isa.dma_copy {#nki-isa-dma_copy}

`nki.isa.dma_copy(dst, src, priority, oob_mode, dge_mode, engine, name)`

**Engine:** Scalar Engine

**Signature:**
```python
isa.dma_copy(dst, src, priority=None, oob_mode=oob_mode_enum.error, dge_mode=dge_mode_enum.unknown, engine=engine_enum.unknown, name=None)
```

Copy data from `src` to `dst` using DMA engines.

This instruction performs data movement between memory locations (SBUF or HBM) using DMA engines.
The operation copies data from the source tensor to the destination tensor: `dst = src`.

`nisa.dma_copy` supports different modes of DMA descriptor generation (DGE):

- `nisa.dge_mode.none`: Neuron Runtime generates DMA descriptors and stores them into HBM before NEFF execution.
- `nisa.dge_mode.swdge`: Gpsimd Engine generates DMA descriptors as part of the `nisa.dma_copy` instruction
  during NEFF execution.
- `nisa.dge_mode.hwdge`: Sync Engine or Scalar Engine sequencers invoke DGE hardware block to generate DMA
  descriptors as part of the `nisa.dma_copy` instruction during NEFF execution.

See `Trainium2 arch guide` and `Introduction to DMA with NKI` for more discussion.

When either `sw_dge` or `hw_dge` mode is used, the `src` and `dst` tensors can have a dynamic start address
which depends on a variable that cannot be resolved at compile time. When `sw_dge` is selected, `nisa.dma_copy`
can also perform a gather or scatter operation, using a list of dynamic indices from SBUF.
In both of these dynamic modes, out-of-bound address checking is turned on automatically during execution.
By default a runtime error is raised (`oob_mode=oob_mode.error` as default setting).
Developers can disable this error and make the `nisa.dma_copy` instruction skip the DMA transfer for a given dynamic
address or index when it is out of bound using `oob_mode=oob_mode.skip`.

**Memory types.**

Both `src` and `dst` tiles can be in HBM or SBUF. However, if both tiles are in SBUF, consider using an alternative
for better performance:

- nisa.tensor_copy  for direct copies
- nisa.nc_n_gather  to gather elements within each partition independently
- nisa.local_gather  to gather elements within groups of partitions

**Data types.**

Both `src` and `dst` tiles can be any supported NKI data types (see [Supported Data Types](nki.api.shared.md#nki-dtype) for more information).

The DMA engines automatically handle data type conversion when `src` and `dst` have different data types.
The conversion is performed through a two-step process: first casting from `src.dtype` to float32, then
from float32 to `dst.dtype`.

**Tile size.**

The total number of data elements in `src` must match that of `dst`.

**Indirect addressing (gather/scatter).**

`nisa.dma_copy` supports indirect addressing for dynamic row selection at runtime. This enables
gather (read from dynamic rows) and scatter (write to dynamic rows) patterns. Indirect addressing
is activated by calling `.ap()` on `src` or `dst` with a `vector_offset` or `scalar_offset`
parameter.

There are two types of indirect addressing:

*Vector indirection* provides per-partition dynamic offsets. Each of the hardware partitions
gets its own index, enabling gather/scatter where different partitions access different rows.
Use `.ap(pattern=..., vector_offset=idx_tensor, indirect_dim=0)` where `idx_tensor` is an
SBUF tensor of shape `(P, 1)` containing one row index per partition.
The tensor being indexed (the one `.ap()` is called on) must be in HBM.

*Scalar indirection* provides a single dynamic offset applied uniformly to all partitions.
Use `.ap(pattern=..., scalar_offset=reg_or_tensor, indirect_dim=N)` where the offset is
either a 1x1 SBUF tensor or a `VirtualRegister` from `nisa.register_alloc()`.

`vector_offset` and `scalar_offset` are mutually exclusive.

**DMA Batching (2D vector_offset).**

The vector_offset tensor can also have shape `(P, M)` with `M > 1`.
The hardware reads the index tensor in column-major order
(`indices.T.flatten()`) and writes the resulting rows to `dst` in linear
(row-major) order.

DMA Batching has the following hardware-imposed restrictions:

#. The 2D vector_offset must be on `src` (gather); a 2D vector_offset on `dst`
   (multi-column scatter) is not supported.
#. When `M > 1`, `P` must be exactly 128
#. Both `src` and `dst` tensors must be contiguous in memory.
#. `src` and `dst` must have the same dtype.

**Indirect gather example** (`vector_offset` on `src`):

```python
import nki
import nki.isa as nisa
import nki.language as nl

@nki.jit
def indirect_gather_kernel(data, indices):
    P, F = indices.shape[0], data.shape[1]
    output = nl.ndarray((P, F), dtype=data.dtype, buffer=nl.shared_hbm)

    idx = nl.ndarray((P, 1), dtype=nl.uint32, buffer=nl.sbuf)
    nisa.dma_copy(dst=idx, src=indices)

    dst = nl.ndarray((P, F), dtype=data.dtype, buffer=nl.sbuf)
    nisa.dma_copy(
        dst=dst,
        src=data.ap(
            pattern=[[F, P], [1, F]],
            vector_offset=idx,
            indirect_dim=0,
        ),
    )

    nisa.dma_copy(dst=output, src=dst)
    return output

```

**Indirect scatter example** (`vector_offset` on `dst`):

```python
import nki
import nki.isa as nisa
import nki.language as nl

@nki.jit
def indirect_scatter_kernel(src_data, indices, output):
    P, F = src_data.shape

    src = nl.ndarray((P, F), dtype=src_data.dtype, buffer=nl.sbuf)
    nisa.dma_copy(dst=src, src=src_data)

    idx = nl.ndarray((P, 1), dtype=nl.uint32, buffer=nl.sbuf)
    nisa.dma_copy(dst=idx, src=indices)

    nisa.dma_copy(
        dst=output.ap(
            pattern=[[F, P], [1, F]],
            vector_offset=idx,
            indirect_dim=0,
        ),
        src=src,
    )
    return output

```

- **dst** — the destination tensor to copy data into
- **src** — the source tensor to copy data from
- **priority** — (optional): DMA quality-of-service priority level 0-3 where lower is higher priority (NeuronCore-v4+ only)
- **dge_mode** — (optional) specify which Descriptor Generation Engine (DGE) mode to use for DMA descriptor generation: `nki.isa.dge_mode.none` (turn off DGE) or `nki.isa.dge_mode.swdge` (software DGE) or `nki.isa.dge_mode.hwdge` (hardware DGE)  or `nki.isa.dge_mode.unknown` (by default, let compiler select the best DGE mode). Hardware based DGE is only supported for NeuronCore-v3 or newer. See [Trainium2 arch guide](../../architecture/trainium2_arch.md) for more information.
- **oob_mode** — (optional) Specifies how to handle out-of-bounds (oob) array indices during indirect access operations. Valid modes are:

    - `oob_mode.error`: (Default) Raises an error when encountering out-of-bounds indices.
    - `oob_mode.skip`: Silently skips any operations involving out-of-bounds indices.

    For example, when using indirect gather/scatter operations, out-of-bounds indices can occur if the index array contains values that exceed the dimensions of the target array.

- **engine** — (optional) the engine to use for HWDGE descriptor generation: `nki.isa.engine.sync` or `nki.isa.engine.scalar`.
               Only valid when `dge_mode=nisa.dge_mode.hwdge`. `nki.isa.engine.unknown` by default.

### nki.isa.dma_transpose {#nki-isa-dma_transpose}

`nki.isa.dma_transpose(dst, src, axes, priority, dge_mode, oob_mode, name)`

**Engine:** DMA Engine

**Signature:**
```python
isa.dma_transpose(dst, src, axes=None, priority=None, dge_mode=dge_mode_enum.unknown, oob_mode=oob_mode_enum.error, name=None)
```

Perform a transpose on input `src` using DMA Engine.

The permutation of transpose follow the rules described below:

1. For 2-d input tile, the permutation will be [1, 0]
2. For 3-d input tile, the permutation will be [2, 1, 0]
3. For 4-d input tile, the permutation will be [3, 1, 2, 0]

**DMA Direct Transpose Constraints**

The only valid `dge_mode` s are `unknown` and `hwdge`. If `hwdge`, this instruction will be lowered
to a Hardware DGE transpose. This has additional restrictions:

1. For 2-d input tiles, `src.shape[0] == 16`.
   For 3-d/4-d input tiles, `src.shape[0]` must be in `{1, 2, 4, 8, 16}`
   and `(src.shape[0] * src.shape[-2]) % 16 == 0`.
2. `src.shape[-1] <= 128`
3. `src.dtype` is 2 bytes

**DMA Indirect Transpose Constraints**

The only valid `dge_mode` s are `unknown` and `swdge`. This instruction will be lowered
to a Software DGE transpose (`dma_gather_transpose`). This has additional restrictions:

#. When `src` is 4D: `len(src[1])` or `len(src[2])` must be 1
#. `src.shape[-1] <= 128`
#. `src.dtype` is 2 bytes
#. `src` tensor must be on HBM
#. `indices` must be 2-d
#. `indices.shape[0] * indices.shape[1]` must be `>=` `src.shape[0]`
#. `src.shape[0]` must be divisible by 16
#. `indices.shape[0]` must be in `[16, 128]` and divisible by 16
#. When `indices.shape[1] > 1`: `indices.shape[0]` must be exactly 128
#. `indices.dtype` is `np.uint32`
#. `indices` tensor must be on SBUF
#. TRN2+ only

Indirect transpose effectively performs the following operation:
`flat_indices = indices.T.flatten()[:src.shape[0]]`
`gathered = src[flat_indices, :]`
`dst = gathered.T`

**Indirect transpose example with 1D indices** (`indices.shape=[128, 1]`):

```python
import nki
import nki.isa as nisa
import nki.language as nl

@nki.jit
def gather_transpose_kernel(src_hbm, idx_hbm):
    P, F = 128, 128
    output = nl.ndarray((P, F), dtype=src_hbm.dtype, buffer=nl.shared_hbm)

    idx_sb = nl.load(idx_hbm)

    dst_sb = nl.ndarray((P, F), dtype=src_hbm.dtype, buffer=nl.sbuf)
    nisa.memset(dst=dst_sb, value=0)

    src_ap = src_hbm.ap(
        pattern=[[P, F], [1, P]],
        vector_offset=idx_sb,
        indirect_dim=0,
    )
    nisa.dma_transpose(dst=dst_sb, src=src_ap, axes=(1, 0))

    nisa.dma_copy(dst=output, src=dst_sb)
    return output

```

**Indirect transpose example with 2D indices** (`indices.shape=[128, N]` where N > 1):

```python
@nki.jit
def gather_transpose_2d_kernel(src_hbm, idx_hbm):
    '''Gather-transpose with 2D indices [128, N] to handle larger gather sets.

    When indices.shape[1] > 1, indices.shape[0] must be exactly 128.
    Total elements gathered = 128 * N (up to src.shape[0]).

    Hardware uses column-major flattening: flat_indices = indices.T.flatten()
    '''
    N_COLS = 2  # Number of columns in index tensor
    P = 128  # Partition dimension (max 128)
    F = 128 * N_COLS  # Free dimension: 256

    output = nl.ndarray((P, F), dtype=src_hbm.dtype, buffer=nl.shared_hbm)

    idx_sb = nl.load(idx_hbm)

    dst_sb = nl.ndarray((P, F), dtype=src_hbm.dtype, buffer=nl.sbuf)
    nisa.memset(dst=dst_sb, value=0)

    src_ap = src_hbm.ap(
        pattern=[[P, F], [1, P]],
        vector_offset=idx_sb,
        indirect_dim=0,
    )
    nisa.dma_transpose(dst=dst_sb, src=src_ap, axes=(1, 0))

    nisa.dma_copy(dst=output, src=dst_sb)
    return output

```

**4D indirect transpose example with 2D indices**:

```python
@nki.jit
def gather_transpose_4d_kernel(src_hbm, idx_hbm):
    '''4D gather-transpose with 2D indices [128, N].

    Pattern: [[d1*d2*d3, F], [d2*d3, d1], [d3, d2], [1, d3]]
    '''
    T, d1, d2, d3 = src_hbm.shape
    _, N = idx_hbm.shape
    F = 128 * N

    idx_sb = nl.load(idx_hbm)

    dst_sb = nl.ndarray((d3, d1, d2, F), dtype=src_hbm.dtype, buffer=nl.sbuf)
    nisa.memset(dst=dst_sb, value=0)

    src_ap = src_hbm.ap(
        pattern=[[d1 * d2 * d3, F], [d2 * d3, d1], [d3, d2], [1, d3]],
        vector_offset=idx_sb,
        indirect_dim=0,
    )

    nisa.dma_transpose(dst=dst_sb, src=src_ap, axes=(3, 1, 2, 0))

    output = nl.ndarray((d3, d1, d2, F), dtype=src_hbm.dtype, buffer=nl.shared_hbm)
    nisa.dma_copy(dst=output, src=dst_sb)

    return output

```

- **dst** — the destination of transpose, must be a tile in SBUF.
- **src** — the source of transpose, must be a tile in HBM or SBUF. `src.dtype == dst.dtype`
- **axes** — transpose axes where the i-th axis of the transposed tile will correspond to the axes[i] of the source.
             Supported axes are `(1, 0)`, `(2, 1, 0)`, and `(3, 1, 2, 0)`.
- **priority** — (optional): DMA quality-of-service priority level 0-3 where lower is higher priority (NeuronCore-v4+ only)
- **dge_mode** — (optional) specify which Descriptor Generation Engine (DGE) mode to use for DMA descriptor generation: `nki.isa.dge_mode.none` (turn off DGE) or `nki.isa.dge_mode.swdge` (software DGE) or `nki.isa.dge_mode.hwdge` (hardware DGE)  or `nki.isa.dge_mode.unknown` (by default, let compiler select the best DGE mode). Hardware based DGE is only supported for NeuronCore-v3 or newer. See [Trainium2 arch guide](../../architecture/trainium2_arch.md) for more information.
- **oob_mode** — (optional) Specifies how to handle runtime out-of-bounds (oob) array indices during indirect access operations. Valid modes are:

    - `oob_mode.error`: (Default) Raises an error when encountering runtime out-of-bounds indices.

    - `oob_mode.skip`: Silently skips any operations involving out-of-bounds indices. Only valid when `src` uses indirect indexing.

### nki.isa.local_gather {#nki-isa-local_gather}

# nki.isa.local_gather

nki.isa.local_gather

nki.isa.local_gather(*dst*, *src_buffer*, *index*, *num_elem_per_idx=1*, *num_valid_indices=None*, *name=None*)[[source]](../../../_modules/nki/isa.html#local_gather)
Gather SBUF data in `src_buffer` using `index` on GpSimd Engine.

Each of the eight GpSimd cores in GpSimd Engine connects to 16 contiguous SBUF partitions
(e.g., core[0] connected to partition[0:16]) and performs gather from the connected 16
SBUF partitions *independently* in parallel. The indices used for gather on each core should also
come from the same 16 connected SBUF partitions.

During execution of the instruction, each GpSimd core reads a 16-partition slice from `index`, flattens
all indices into a 1D array `indices_1d` (along the partition dimension first).
By default with no `num_valid_indices` specified, each GpSimd core
will treat all indices from its corresponding 16-partition `index` slice as valid indices.
However, when the number of valid indices per core
is not a multiple of 16, users can explicitly specify the valid index count per core in `num_valid_indices`.
Note, `num_valid_indices` must not exceed the total element count in each 16-partition `index` slice
(i.e., `num_valid_indices <= index.size / (index.shape[0] / 16)`).

Next, each GpSimd core uses the flattened `indices_1d` indices as *partition offsets* to gather from
the connected 16-partition slice of `src_buffer`. Optionally, this API also allows gathering of multiple
contiguous elements starting at each index to improve gather throughput, as indicated by `num_elem_per_idx`.
Behavior of out-of-bound index access is undefined.

Even though all eight GpSimd cores can gather with completely different indices, a common use case for
this API is to make all cores gather with the same set of indices (i.e., partition offsets). In this case,
users can generate indices into 16 partitions, replicate them eight times to 128 partitions and then feed them into
`local_gather`.

As an example, if `src_buffer` is (128, 512) in shape and `index` is (128, 4) in shape, where the partition
dimension size is 128, `local_gather` effectively performs the following operation:


```python
num_gpsimd_cores = 8
num_partitions_per_core = 16

src_buffer = np.random.random_sample([128, 512, 4]).astype(np.float32) * 100
index_per_core = np.random.randint(low=0, high=512, size=(16, 4), dtype=np.uint16)
# replicate 8 times for 8 GpSimd cores
index = np.tile(index_per_core, (num_gpsimd_cores, 1))
num_elem_per_idx = 4
index_hw = index * num_elem_per_idx
num_valid_indices = 64
output_shape = (128, 4, 16, 4)

num_active_cores = index.shape[0] / num_partitions_per_core
num_valid_indices = num_valid_indices if num_valid_indices \
  else index.size / num_active_cores

output_np = np.ndarray(shape=(128, num_valid_indices, num_elem_per_idx),
                       dtype=src_buffer.dtype)

for i_core in range(num_gpsimd_cores):
  start_par = i_core * num_partitions_per_core
  end_par = (i_core + 1) * num_partitions_per_core
  indices_1d = index[start_par:end_par].flatten(order='F')[0: num_valid_indices]

  output_np[start_par:end_par, :, :] = np.take(
    src_buffer[start_par:end_par],
    indices_1d, axis=1)

output_np = output_np.reshape(output_shape)
```


`local_gather` preserves the input data types from `src_buffer` in the gather output.
Therefore, no data type casting is allowed in this API. The indices in `index` tile must be uint16 types.

This API has three tile size constraints [subject to future relaxation]:

* The partition axis size of `src_buffer` must match that of `index` and must
be a multiple of 16. In other words, `src_buffer.shape[0] == index.shape[0] and src_buffer.shape[0] % 16 == 0`.

* The number of contiguous elements to gather per index per partition `num_elem_per_idx`
must be one of the following values: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]`.

* The number of indices for gather per core must be less than or equal to 4096.

Parameters:

* **dst** – an output tile of the gathered data

* **src_buffer** – an input tile for gathering.

* **index** – an input tile with indices used for gathering.

* **num_elem_per_idx** – an optional integer value to read multiple contiguous elements per index per partition; default is 1.

* **num_valid_indices** – an optional integer value to specify the number of valid indices per GpSimd core; default is
`index.size / (index.shape[0] / 16)`.

### nki.isa.memset {#nki-isa-memset}

`nki.isa.memset(dst, value, engine, name)`

**Engine:** GpSimd Engine

**Signature:**
```python
isa.memset(dst, value, engine=engine_enum.unknown, name=None)
```

Initialize `dst` by filling it with a compile-time constant `value`, using Vector or GpSimd Engine.
The memset instruction supports all valid NKI dtypes (see [Supported Data Types](nki.api.shared.md#nki-dtype)).

- **dst** — destination tile to initialize.
- **value** — the constant value to initialize with
- **engine** — specify which engine to use for memset: `nki.isa.engine.vector` or `nki.isa.engine.gpsimd` ;
               `nki.isa.engine.unknown` by default, lets compiler select the best engine for the given
               input tile shape

> **Note:**
> For x4 packed types (`float8_e4m3fn_x4`, `float8_e5m2_x4`,
> `float4_e2m1fn_x4`), only `value=0` is supported.
