## Functions

### nki.language.device_print {#nki-language-device_print}

# nki.language.device_print

nki.language.device_print

nki.language.device_print(*print_prefix*, *tensor*)[[source]](../../../_modules/nki/language.html#device_print)
Print a message with a string `print_prefix` followed by the value of a tile `tensor`.

By default, using this function will not result in your tensors being printed out. When running your kernel,
you need to define the environment variable `NEURON_RT_DEBUG_OUTPUT_DIR` and point it to a directory that will
store the tensor data grouped by prefix each time the device_print instruction is executed.

The structure of the directory will be `<print_prefix>/core_<logical core id>/<iteration>/...`.

Listing 12 Example usage

```python
import nki.isa as nisa
import nki.language as nl

def my_nki_kernel(input_tensor):
    a_tile = sbuf.view(input_tensor.dtype, input_tensor.shape)
    nisa.dma_copy(a_tile, input_tensor)
    nl.device_print("a_tile", a_tile)

    ...
```


> **Note**
>
> Warning
> 
> 
> This feature is only available when using the NxD Inference library.

Parameters:

* **print_prefix** ([*str*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str)) – prefix of the print message. This string is evaluated at trace time and must be a constant expression.

* **tensor** – tensor to print out. Can be in SBUF or HBM.

Returns:
None

Construct a dynamic slice for simple tensor indexing.


```python
import nki.language as nl
import nki.isa as nisa

@nki.jit
def example_kernel(in_tensor):
  out_tensor = nl.ndarray(in_tensor.shape, dtype=in_tensor.dtype,

    nisa.dma_copy(dst=tile, src=in_tensor[:, (i * 512):((i + 1) * 512)])
    # Same as above but use ds (dynamic slice) instead of the native
    # slice syntax
